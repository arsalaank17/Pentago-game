# Pentago-game
## Introduction
This project is a text-based user interface (TUI) implementation of the board game Pentago, developed as part of one of our programming projects. The game was created by Arsalaan Khan and Kevin Schurman. Pentago is a strategic board game for two players featuring four 3×3 grids arranged into a larger 6×6 grid. The game introduces a unique twist to the classic Connect 4 gameplay: after placing a marble, the player must rotate one of the grids by 90°, altering the board each turn. The objective is to be the first player to align five marbles in a row.

## Features
Game Modes:
- Server-Side Implementation: Connect and play with other users over a network.
- Client-Side Implementation: Connect to a server to play against remote players.
- Direct Implementation: Play locally against another player or a computer.

## Programming language
 Java, chosen for its simplicity, power, and support for various programming concepts such as encapsulation, interfaces, and references/pointers.
